Normalisation is a technique of organizing the data in the database and to avoid data redundancy and undesirable characteristics 
like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies.
 
Normalization is used for mainly two purpose:
                  -Eliminating redundant data.
                  -Ensuring data dependencies make sense i.e data is logically stored.

Normalization Rules: 
1st Normal - A relation is in 1NF if it contains an atomic value(No Multi-Value is Present in Table).
2nd Normal Form - A relation will be in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.
			(means we can easily identify all the columns by using primary key)
3rd Normal Form - A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and no transition dependency exists.
			(Not Present any X -> Y,Y -> Z, X ->Z this is transition dependency)
BCNF - All the other attributes can only be dependent on Primary Key.

1.) 1NF :- A column of table cannot hold multivalue , it can only store single(atomic) value.

	emp_id	emp_name	emp_address	emp_mobile

	101	Herschel	New Delhi	8912312390
	102	Jon		Kanpur		8812121212
						9900012222
	103	Ron		Chennai		7778881212 

  After removing Multivalue from above table now following table is in 1NF

	
	emp_id	emp_name	emp_address	emp_mobile

	101	Herschel	New Delhi	8912312390
	102	Jon		Kanpur		8812121212
	102	Jon		Kanpur		9900012222
	103	Ron		Chennai		7778881212

2.) 2NF :- No non-prime attribute is dependent on the proper subset of any candidate key of table.


	teacher_id	subject		teacher_age
	111		Maths		38
	111		Physics		38
	222		Biology		38
        
	Candidate key - subject,teacherid
	non-prime - teacher_age
	After reducing above table it can divide into 2 tables

	
	teacher_id	subject
	111		Maths
	111		Physics
	222		Biology

	teacher_id	teacher_age
	111		38
	222		38

3.) 3NF :- Transitive functional dependency of non-prime attribute on any super key should be removed.

		
	emp_id		emp_name	emp_zip		emp_state	emp_city	emp_district
	1001		John		282005		UP		Agra		Dayal Bagh
	1002		Ajeet		222008		TN		Chennai		M-City
	1006		Lora		282007		TN		Chennai		Urrapakkam

 		Like by emp_zip we can derive state,city,distric so its show transitive dependency

	emp_id		emp_name	emp_zip
	1001		John		282005
	1002		Ajeet		222008
	1006		Lora		282007

	emp_zip		emp_state	emp_city	emp_district
	282005		UP		Agra		Dayal Bagh
	222008		TN		Chennai		M-City	
	282007		TN		Chennai		Urrapakkam
4.)BCNF - Boyce Codd normal form
	   It describe that we can reduce the table such that all the attribute is fully dependent on Primary key of that table.

		
	emp_id		emp_nationality		emp_dept			dept_type	dept_no_of_emp
	1001		Austrian		Production and planning		D001		200
	1001		Austrian		stores				D001		250
        
 	we try to reduce above table into table such that all attribute is Only depend on Primary key (emp_id)
	

	emp_id		emp_nationality
	1001		Austrian


	emp_dept			dept_type	dept_no_of_emp
	Production and planning		D001		200
	stores				D001		250


	emp_id		emp_dept
	1001		Production and planning
	1001		stores
